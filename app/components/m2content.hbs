            liver,
            parmecium.
            You should understand how to focus in on object after this lab as well as calculate your magnification

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This week we followed up with our drawing of human heart watching
            two videos on the heart and blood blow. The main take away is way blood flows through
            out circulatory system into and out of the heart. Viens lead back to the heart and generally contain
            deoxgenated
            blood. Arteries lead away from the heart and generally carry oxgenated blood. the exceptions see diagram of
            the heart to and from the lungs.

        <p><b>Lab</b>this week was Human blood cell smear. I wanted to add that when we do Microscope labs,
            it's really important that we actually look at the slides and try reconize what we are looking at and
            Identify parts.
            Most of us our treating this a picture slide show, and that's not really the point. You'll need to develop
            your eye to be a bit more
            detailed oriented.</p>
